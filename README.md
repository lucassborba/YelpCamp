Hello there!
This is my first project after I finish my Web Developer Bootcamp called YelpCamp.
It consists of includes campgrounds with pictures, descriptions, prices and, you could add a review for each campground with stars rate and comments. There is a map showing the location of each campground and a general map with clusters showing areas with more options of campgrounds.
The intention was to simulate an Airbnb but with campgrounds.
Feel free to leave you comments and thought to help me to improve this code.
I have been using **JavaScript,** **HTML,** **CSS,** **Bootstrap,** Express,** **DOM,** **EJS,** **Middleware,** **Cookies,** **Session,** **Flash,** **Passport,** **Bcrypt,** **Joi,** **Cloudinary,** **MapBox,** **GeoJson,** **MongoDB,** **Helmet,** **Cross-Site Script,** **Scratch** ...
Cheers,
